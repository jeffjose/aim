# Migration Status

## âœ… Migration Complete!

All commands have been successfully migrated from `src/subcommands/` to `src/commands/` using the new SubCommand trait pattern. The old `subcommands` directory has been removed.

### âœ… Migrated Commands

1. **ls** - Lists connected devices
2. **run** - Runs commands on devices
3. **copy** - Copies files to/from devices
4. **rename** - Renames devices
5. **server** - Manages ADB server
6. **adb** - Runs arbitrary ADB commands
7. **config** - Displays configuration
8. **dmesg** - Runs dmesg command
9. **perfetto** - Runs perfetto trace
10. **screenrecord** - Records device screen
11. **getprop** - Gets device properties
12. **screenshot** - Takes screenshots

### âœ… What Was Done

1. **Migrated all 12 commands** to use the new SubCommand trait pattern
2. **Updated main.rs** to use CommandRunner for all non-app commands
3. **Removed the old `src/subcommands/` directory** completely
4. **Updated all imports** to remove references to the old subcommands module
5. **Verified compilation** - everything builds successfully

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Work

1. **app** commands still use a hybrid approach but are properly integrated
2. Future work: Migrate app commands to fully use CommandRunner pattern

## Migration Pattern

All migrated commands follow this pattern:

```rust
pub struct MyCommand;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, clap::Args)]
pub struct MyCommandArgs {
    /// Device ID (required if multiple devices are connected)
    pub device_id: Option<String>,
    // Other command-specific arguments
}

impl MyCommand {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }
}

#[async_trait]
impl SubCommand for MyCommand {
    type Args = MyCommandArgs;
    
    async fn run(&self, ctx: &CommandContext, args: Self::Args) -> Result<()> {
        // Implementation using old library functions
    }
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent device_id support** - All commands now properly handle device disambiguation
2. **Unified architecture** - All commands use the SubCommand trait pattern
3. **Clean organization** - Commands live in `src/commands/` with no duplicates
4. **Flat CLI preserved** - Users see no change in command structure
5. **CommandRunner routing** - Clean separation between CLI parsing and command execution
6. **Modular design** - Easy to add new commands following the established pattern

## Technical Details

- Commands currently use stable library functions from `src/library/adb.rs`
- The new ADB implementation modules are ready for future integration
- All commands compile and are ready for use
